Git we can call as version control system:
------------------------------------------
Git is a version control system that developers use all over the world. It helps you track different versions of your code and collaborate with other developers. If you are working on a project over time, you may want to keep track of which changes were made, by whom, and when those changes were made.

VCS:
----
Centralised Version Control System(CVCS)	--> SVN
	--> We can move only one commit to Remote
	--> We should connect internet always
Distributed Version Control System(DVCS)	--> Github / Bitbucket 
	--> We can move multiple commits to Remote/Centralised
	--> Its not required to connect internet always, while pushing we need to connect

Create Repository:
------------------
Remote place we need to create

--> Install git in our laptop

git clone <url>			--> Used to get remote repo to local

If you want to convert local folder as git repository, we can use
	--> git init
	
If you want to push changes to remote:
---------------------------------------
git add
git commit -m <message>
git push	

git status
