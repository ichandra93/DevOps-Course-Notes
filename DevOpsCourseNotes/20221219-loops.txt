Loops in linux:
---------------
A loop is a powerful programming tool that enables you to execute a set of commands repeatedly

1. while loop
2. for loop
3. until loop

while loop:
------------
while command
do
   Statement(s) to be executed if command is true
done

#!/bin/bash
a=1
while [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
    echo "value for a: $a"
    a=`expr $a + 1`
done

until condition is going to fail loop will be execute

until loop:
-----------
until command
do
   Statement(s) to be executed until command is true
done


#!/bin/bash
a=1
until [ $a -gt 10 ]
do
    echo "value for a: $a"
    a=`expr $a + 1`
done

until condition is true statements will be execute

for loop:
---------
The for loop operates on lists of items. It repeats a set of commands for every item in a list.

for var in word1 word2 ... wordN
do
   Statement(s) to be executed for every word.
done

for i in 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10
do
	echo "value is: $i"
done

#!/bin/bash
for num in {1..10}
do
	echo "value is: $num"
done


for (( EXP1; EXP2; EXP3 ))
do
    command1
    command2
    command3
done

#!/bin/bash
for (( i=1; i<=10; i++ ))
do 
	echo "value is: $i"
done

----------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash
file_name="test.txt"
for i in `ls *.txt`
do
    if [ $i == $file_name ]
    then
        rm -rf $i
        echo "$i file is deleted"
    fi
done 

case:
------
case word in
   pattern1)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern1 matches
      ;;
   pattern2)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern2 matches
      ;;
   pattern3)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern3 matches
      ;;
   *)
     Default condition to be executed
     ;;
esac


#!/bin/bash
FRUIT=$1

case "$FRUIT" in
   "apple") echo "Apple pie is quite tasty." 
   ;;
   "banana") echo "I like banana nut bread." 
   ;;
   "kiwi") echo "New Zealand is famous for kiwi." 
   ;;
   *) echo "Fruit name not exist, please provide only apple/banana/kiwi"
   ;;
esac

different types of extractions 	--> zip, tar, 7z

#!/bin/bash
fullfile=apache-maven-3.8.6-bin.tar.gz
if [ -f $fullfile ]
then
    echo "$fullfile is exist"
    file_name="$(basename -- "$fullfile")"
    extraction_format="${file_name##*.}"
    echo $extraction_format

    case "$extraction_format" in
       "zip") unzip $file_name
    		  echo "$file_name is extracted with unzip"
       ;;
       "gz") tar -xvf $file_name
    		  echo "$file_name is extracted with tar"
       ;;
       *) echo "extension is not exist"
       ;;
    esac
else
    echo "$fullfile is not exist"
fi
