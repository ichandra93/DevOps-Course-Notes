Data source in terraform:
---------------------------
Data sources in Terraform are used to get information about resources external to Terraform, and use them to set up your Terraform resources.

state file:
-----------
The terraform state file, by default, is named terraform. tfstate and is held in the same directory where Terraform is run. It is created after running terraform apply . The actual content of this file is a JSON formatted mapping of the resources defined in the configuration and those that exist in your infrastructure

user_data:
----------
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami               = var.ami_id
  instance_type     = var.inst_type
  key_name          = "weekend"
  security_groups   = [aws_security_group.http_allow.name]
  user_data = <<EOF
    #!/bin/bash
	sudo yum install git java-1.8.0-openjdk -y
    sudo yum install -y httpd
    sudo systemctl start httpd
    sudo systemctl enable httpd
    sudo chkconfig httpd on
    echo "<h1>Deployed via Terraform</h1>" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html
  EOF

  tags = {
    Name = "HelloWorld"
  }
}
